Khat is the creation of North Carolina artist Kimberly Stephens Lanham. She was born in the beautiful hills of central North Carolina and has honed her artistic skills in many different mediums for decades. Dabbling in everything from sculpture to murals, portraits to paints, jewelry making to actual tattooing, Kimberly is now pursuing her graphic design degree to flesh out her accomplishments even more.<br><br>
        Though her art is her passion, Kim is a mother first to three beautiful little girls, two fuzzy and eccentric canines, a diabolical feline and two lazy, lounging lizards. Take a peek into her crazy zoo life by visiting her daily comic page, <a href="com.html">Khat Comics!</a><br><br>
        If it's a detailed portrait you're looking for, hop on over to the <a href="ill.html">illustrations</a> page to check out a few of her paintings and commissioned fine art pieces.<br><br>
        Khat is also proud to offer graphic design work for all types of businesses and clients. If you are interested in logo design, advertisement, or just need some tips to boost your brand, some examples of Kim's work can be found on the design page <a href="design.html">here!</a><img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img2"></div>
